This is a C# implementation of the Discord RPC library which was originally written in C++. This avoids having to use the official C++ and instead provides a managed way of using the Rich Presence within Unity.

This package contains all the tools, inspectors and helpers for a Unity3D game all in one package including a fully customizable Unity Editor Client to show off what your working on in Unity! 

While the official C++ library has been deprecated, this library has continued support and development for all your Rich Presence need, without requiring the Game SDK.
